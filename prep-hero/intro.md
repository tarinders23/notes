# Self Introduction

## Professional Summary
Hello, I am **Poonam Rajput**. I am an HR Business Partner with over **7 years of professional experience**.

Currently, I have been working with **Amdocs** (Gurgaon) for the past nearly 6 years, and prior to that, I worked with **Rosmerta Technologies**.

## Motivation & Background
Coming from a business family, I grew up observing how organizations function. My family directors used to manage factory operations, and I saw firsthand that handling manpower effectively is the backbone of any business.
This sparked my urge to learn **how businesses work, how they earn**, and what factors make an impact. This curiosity led me to transition from an Engineering background to an MBA in HR, to pursue a career where I could directly influence organizational success through people strategy.

2.  **Global HR Operations:** Managing partners across diverse locations (USA, Brazil, Bulgaria, Israel, India).
3.  **Core HR Processes:** Leading **Talent Development**, **Performance Approaches (PMP)**, **Progression cycles**, and the **Salary Review (SR) process**.
4.  **Strategic Initiatives:**
    *   Driving **Diversity & Inclusion** initiatives.
    *   Leading **Employee Engagement** planning for major sites.
    *   **Succession Planning:** Identifying and grooming key talent.
