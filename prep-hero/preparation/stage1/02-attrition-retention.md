**"We are observing a sudden spike in attrition (25%) among our frontend Sales Officers in the Gurgaon region right before the festive season. This poses a huge risk to our Diwali targets. How do you approach this crisis?"**

## 💡 The "Hero" Approach

### 1. Root Cause Analysis (Stop the bleeding)
"I cannot fix what I don't understand. I would immediately launch a 'Pulse Check':
*   **Exit Interview deep-dive:** Is it Compensation? Manager toxicity? Or Burnout?
*   **Market Intelligence:** Has a competitor (like Ola or TVS) launched a hiring drive with aggressive incentives?
*   **Span of Control:** Are managers overwhelmed, leading to poor team support?"

### 2. Short-Term Containment (Survival Strategy)
"To save the festive season targets:
*   **Retention Bonus:** Propose a 'Festive Completion Bonus'—payable only if they stay through the season.
*   **Incentive Communication:** Re-communicate the sales incentive schemes vividly. Sometimes people leave because they don't do the math on what they could earn.
*   **Leader Connect:** Have the Zonal Head do skip-level meetings to reassure the team."

### 3. Long-Term Fix (Prevent Recurrence)
"Once the fire is out, I look at the structure:
*   **Hiring Source:** Are we hiring job-hoppers? I’d analyze the source mix (Agency vs Referral). Referral hires usually stay longer.
*   **Career Pathing:** Show them the 'Hero' journey. If a Sales Officer sees no growth to Area Manager, they will leave. I would formalize a 'High Flyer' track for the top 20% sales officers."
