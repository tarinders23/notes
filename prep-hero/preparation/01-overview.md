## 🧠 The Winning Mindset: "The Business Enabler"

**Stop thinking like an "HR Manager" and start thinking like a "Business Consultant".**

*   **Old Poonam (Amdocs):** "I managed the performance appraisal cycle."
*   **New Poonam (Hero Candidate):** "I drove a high-performance culture by retaining 95% of our critical talent through targeted interventions."

**Key Pivot:** You are moving from a highly digitized, remote-friendly IT environment (Amdocs) to a high-touch, relationship-driven, field-heavy Manufacturing/Sales environment (Hero).
*   *Acknowledge the shift:* "I bring the digital agility and data-driven rigor of the tech sector, which I believe can modernize and speed up HR delivery for Hero's sales force."
