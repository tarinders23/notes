# Interview Preparation Plan for Poonam Rajput - Manager HRBP at Hero MotoCorp

## 1. Executive Summary & Strategy
*   **Candidate Strength:** Strong match with 7+ years of HRBP experience (Amdocs), aligning perfectly with the 6-8 years requirement. Strong background in Org Design, Performance Management, and Stakeholder Management.
*   **Gap/Focus Area:** The JD explicitly mentions "Sales & Marketing function" retention strategies (for the presentation) and specific KPIs like "Ignite 2.0". Poonam needs to tailor her telecom/IT background (Amdocs) to the manufacturing/auto-sales context of Hero MotoCorp.
*   **Core Narrative:** Position yourself as a strategic business enabler who uses data and OD frameworks to drive productivity and culture, transitioning from IT/Tech HRBP to a dynamic Auto-sector HRBP role.
