# Stage 1 Scenario: Performance Management of Senior Sales Leaders

**Topic:** Performance Management (PMS) & Difficult Conversations
**Competency:** Managerial Effectiveness & Business Partnering

---

## ❓ The Scenario/Question
**"You have a Zonal Manager in the North handling a key territory. He has been with the company for 10 years and is well-liked by dealers, but his sales numbers have flatlined for two consecutive quarters while competitors are growing. The Business Head feels awkward addressing it. How do you handle this as an HRBP?"**

## 💡 The "Hero" Approach

### 1. Diagnosis (Data first, Emotion second)
"Before any conversation, I would look at the data to isolate the root cause. Is it a **Will** issue or a **Skill** issue?
*   **Market Data:** Is the entire North zone down, or just his territory? (External vs Internal factors).
*   **Team Feedback:** I’d discreetly check the pulse of his reporting Area Managers. Is there a leadership gap causing the slump?"

### 2. The Intervention (The "Crucial Conversation")
"I would coach the Business Head to lead the discussion, supported by HR. The conversation follows these steps:
*   **Acknowledge Tenure:** Respect his 10-year contribution.
*   **Present Facts:** 'Sales are flat 0% vs Competitor growth of 12%'. Remove subjectivity.
*   **Ask Questions:** 'What is stopping you from hitting the numbers this time?'"

### 3. The Action Plan (PIP vs. Role Fit)
"If it’s a motivation issue, we reset targets. If it’s a capability issue (e.g., unable to sell new EV range), we intervene with:
*   **Training:** Specific upskilling on digital sales/EV product tech.
*   **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):** A 60-day structured plan with bi-weekly checkpoints.
*   **Outcome:** If performance doesn't improve, we discuss role realignment (e.g., Dealer Development vs Sales) or exit. My role is to ensure the process is fair, documented, and business-focused, protecting the organization legally while respecting the individual dignity."
