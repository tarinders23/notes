# Stage 1 Scenario: EV Skilling Intervention (TNI)

**Topic:** Learning & Development (Capability Building)
**Competency:** Talent Development & Future Readiness

---

## ❓ The Scenario/Question
**"Hero is aggressively pushing into the EV (Electric Vehicle) market with the Vida range. Our legacy sales team is used to selling Splendor/Passion (ICE engines). They struggle to explain battery tech and charging infrastructure to tech-savvy customers. Design a capability intervention."**

## 💡 The "Hero" Approach

### 1. Training Need Identification (TNI)
"Selling an EV is consultative selling, not transactional.
*   **Mystery Audit:** I would send mystery shoppers to dealerships to record the current pitch. This gives me real data on the 'knowledge gaps' (e.g., struggling to explain range anxiety or battery warranty)."

### 2. The 70-20-10 Learning Intervention
"A classroom session isn't enough for a mindset shift.
*   **10% (Education):** specialized 'Vida Product Certified' workshops. Not just specs, but *storytelling*.
*   **20% (Exposure):** Peer learning. Pair the legacy sales staff with the new 'Gen Z' hires who are digital natives. Let them shadow each other.
*   **70% (Experience):** Ride & Feel. Every Sales Officer must ride the EV as their daily commuter for a week. You cannot sell what you don't experience. This builds conviction."

### 3. Impact Measurement
"I don't measure 'Training Hours'. I measure impact:
*   **Pre-Post Assessment:** Product knowledge score improvement.
*   **Conversion Ratio:** Track the 'Walk-in to Booking' ratio specifically for the EV range for the trained cohort vs untrained. This proves ROI to the business leaders."
