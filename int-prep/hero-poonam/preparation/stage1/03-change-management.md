# Stage 1 Scenario: Driving Change Adoption (New PMS/Tech)

**Topic:** Change Management & Org Effectiveness
**Competency:** Building a Future-Ready Workforce

---

## ❓ The Scenario/Question
**"We are rolling out a new digital tool for daily sales tracking and Performance Management (PMS) that requires real-time geo-tagging. The field force is resisting, calling it 'policing' and refusing to adopt it. How do you drive adoption?"**

---

## 💡 The "Hero" Approach

### 1. Acknowledge and Reframe (Empathy)
"Resistance is natural. I would start by listening. I'd conduct focus group discussions (FGDs) not to sell the tool, but to hear concerns.
*   **The Narrative:** I would reframe the narrative from 'Monitoring' to 'Empowerment'. This isn't about tracking *you*; it's about tracking *your success* so we can calculate incentives faster."

### 2. The ADKAR Model (Structured Change)
"I apply the ADKAR model for change:
*   **Awareness:** explaining the 'Why'. (e.g., 'Manual reports take you 1 hour; this app takes 10 mins. You save 50 mins/day').
*   **Desire:** WIIFM (What's in it for me?). Link adoption to ease of incentive payout.
*   **Knowledge & Ability:** Run localized, hands-on workshops. Don't just email a PDF manual."

### 3. Reinforcement (Carrot and Stick)
"I would partner with the Business Head to gamify adoption:
*   **Gamification:** 'Digital Champions'—recognize the first 100% adopters in the Zonal Townhall.
*   **Embed Strategy:** After 2 months, make tool usage mandatory for attendance marking. If you aren't on the app, you aren't 'present'.
*   **Role Modeling:** The Zonal Head must use the tool themselves. If leadership bypasses it, the team will too."
