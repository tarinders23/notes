# 1. General Tips

1. **Understand the STAR Method:** Familiarize yourself with the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for structuring your responses.
2. **Listen attentively**
3. **Be concise**
4. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
5. **Avoid Negative Language:** Refrain from speaking negatively about past employers, colleagues, or experiences.
6. **Stay professional and constructive:** You don't want to be disrespectful, offensive, arrogant, mean, confrontational.
7. **Highlight your strengths:** Frame your responses in a positive light. Even when discussing challenges or failures, focus on what you learned and how you improved.
8. **Ask thoughtful questions:** Interviewing is a two-way street. Ask questions to learn more about the company, culture, etc..
9. **It's ok to not have answer to every question:** If you are asked a question which you can't recall from past experience you can tell the interviewer *"I think I don't actually have this experience but I would love to tell you how I would react in this situation"*
10. **Highlight you are a Team Player:** Strike a balance between highlighting your qualities and your ability to work in a team and help others. Talk about stories that reflect qualities and team work (both your qualities and team work).
11. **Be Honest:** If you don't know the answer to a question, it's better to admit it than to make something up.
12. **Prepare ahead of time:** Preparing before the interview will help you remember things more easily and frame answers better.
13. **Practice common questions:** Best way to prepare is to go through common interview questions and think about how you would answer them.

# **2. STAR Framework**

STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

- **Situation (S):** Begin by describing the specific situation or context you were in. Set the stage for your story. Provide enough background information to help the interviewer understand the scenario.
- **Task (T):** Next, explain the task or challenge you were faced with. What were the goals or objectives you needed to achieve in that situation?
- **Action (A):** Describe the actions you took to address the task or challenge. This is the most critical part of your response. Be specific about the steps you took, your responsibilities, and your thought process. Focus on your actions, not the team's actions.
- **Result (R):** Share the results or outcomes of your actions. Be quantitative whenever possible. Describe the impact of your actions on the situation or task.
- **Impact (I): Share the impact on you and org in future.**

# 4. Behavioural Questions

### **1. Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager.**

**Situation:** At Last org, A new team was created to upsell careplans, And, I was leading backend for CP growth team with new manager. For the first phase android release, my manager pushes to go with 6 features/experiments. So that we have enough time to conclude the result of experiments. But I believed it was not possible given the timelines irrespective of number of team members or with full parallelation.

**Task:** My task was to get the best strategy / plan to deliver most feature in first phase

**Action:** I scheduled a meet with all the developers [android team and backend team]. Get the what’s the main blocker feature then, we replaced it with low effort feature. After getting buy-in from all the developers, I scheduled 1:1 meet with my manager, and present the new release plan.

**Result:** My manager appreciated the thorough analysis and was impressed with the initiative. This incident not only led to a more robust release plan but also strengthened my relationship with my manager

### **2. Tell me about a situation when you had a conflict with a teammate.**

It consists of six stages: 

1. preparing for resolution, 
2. creating a safe space, 
3. listening actively, 
4. exploring the situation, 
5. building solutions, 
6. and following up

Taks schedular (Prashant)

**Situation:** During working as SD2, In peer-review i did not approve the approach taken by my team mate. The team mate’s approach was a tactical quick fix. Therefore I proposed a ideal new approach which was a little time consuming. He was disagreed with my approach as it was a bit complex and time taking.

**Task:** I decided to resolve this conflict in a way that would not only maintain team harmony but also ensure the best technical solution was chosen.

Action:  ****I initiated a meeting with him to understand his perspective and concerns. I listened attentively to his reasoning and explained my viewpoint and the benefits of my approach, including better maintainability and future proof. Realizing that we were both not fully aligned, I suggested we present both approaches to the team and gather input. During the team meeting, we discussed the pros and cons of each method in detail. I made sure to keep the discussion focused on the technical merits of each approach rather than personal preferences.

**Result:** The team ultimately decided that a combination of both our approaches was the best way forward. This hybrid solution combined the fastness of his method with the future proof and maintainabilty of mine. This resolution not only led to the successful completion of the feature but also improved my professional relationship with Sarah. We both appreciated each other's expertise and commitment to the project. 

### **3. Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?**

**Situation: As SDE 2, there was a Release related to tata-neu-coin integration, all the release checklist were made.**

**Task: To release it without impact.**

**Action: I**n my eagerness to meet the deadline and impress the team, I rushed through the testing phase, We released it and after post sanity there were multiple blocker bugs left.

**Result:** Therefore we reverted the release. And did a through testing this time and released it again

**Impact:** This teaches me a great lesson and give me a pointer to introinspect my actions for next time. After this incident. These kind of things never happend

### **4. Describe a time when you led a team. What was the outcome?**

CP growth POD Team

outcome:

1. Team: Got to know new people and found out their skill set
2. Tech: Got to know new code base of merch service(maintain home page)
3. Business: increase sales of cp by 700 per day. from 3200 to 3900 (android only)

### **5. Describe a time when you went above and beyond the requirements for a project.**

Migrate Payment service to new framework

Action: Also did refactoring for better maintainability, added fallbacks, caching, cirucuit breakers.

Result: Better p95 and apdex score.

### **6. Describe a situation where you saw a problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.**

Refunds Sync and auto refunds for unplaced orders.

### 7. **Tell me about a complex technical project you've worked on.**

Optimizing analytical Engine

**Situation: Org was planning to have a near real time analytical engine to calculate risk on 1000s of factors. And we already had analytical engine, but it was for pre-processing historical data. It takes around 3 sec to calculate risk on 1 security (0.3 security per sec). Org was planning to build a new product from scratch to calculate real time risks (~ 1.5 year plan). Tcl/python + C++**

Task: Before going further my manager asked me to check the feasibilty of optimization.

He was expecting if we can 10 securities in 1. Then it can be usable. 

Action:

I did a initial nerve check (2 weeks) and showed a there is a scope for improvement. I get the buy-in from the manager, i said i can bring it to 10 security per secound for sure. for more time for the project (3 months). Then i did multiple optimizations

1. Lot of logic was there in tcl and python. I moved it to c++ (python extension).
2. Instead of calculating from scratch i used iterative approach (DP) (Reuse intermediate results). used the calculation of base factors in derived factors.
3. Fully utilize the multithreading in C++.

**Result:**

The calculation to 300-600 securities per second. (1000x optimization). Due to this we were able to used our existing engine to provide support for new real time project. This was a huge win for the team.

### **8. What is the biggest challenge you have worked on?**

**Situation:** After tata **accusation of 1mg. We need to intergate 1mg with tata digital.**

**Task**: 

1. sync user data from and deduplicate users (E1, M1, E2, M1). Merge users.
2. share data (setup-data pipelines) both sides (identity, orders, payments)
3. tata neu coins instead of 1mgcash

Out of these merge users was the most challenging task.

**Action**. The first task was to found out the candidates for merge. Earlier 1mg allowed user to register via email only. And we have multiple users with (m1, e1, e2..) at 1mg. But with the same (e1, m2) was there on bigbasket/croma. After deciding merge strategy (p0-tatadigital). We started asking revalidating phone number from user. We also merge user, history(order and payment)

Result: After lot of discussions / oncalls the migration was complete. I have learnt lot of things related to stake holder (external) management and communication issue to non-tech people, handling technicalaties at the same time.

### **9. Assume you are given a task to design a system. How would you do it? How would you resolve ambiguity?**

1. When given a task to design a system, my approach involves several key steps to ensure clarity and effectiveness in the design process. 
2. Firstly, I start with requirement gathering. This involves discussing with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations/goal from the system. Clarify the scope and functionality required.
3. This helps in understanding the technical aspects, such as the appropriate technology stack, and any constraints or regulatory compliance requirements. 
4. Next, I draft an initial design proposal. This typically includes outlining the system architecture, data flow diagrams, and a basic prototype or wireframe of the user interface. This step is crucial for visualizing how different components of the system will interact and function. Resolving ambiguity is a key part of the process. I do this by setting up review meetings with stakeholders where I present my initial design and gather feedback. 
5. These discussions are essential for clarifying any vague requirements and aligning the design with the stakeholders' vision. I take detailed notes and make sure to address each point of ambiguity with concrete information or alternatives. Once the design is refined and agreed upon, I create detailed documentation, including technical specifications, user stories, and workflow diagrams. 
6. This serves as a guide for the development team and ensures everyone is on the same page. Throughout the process, effective communication, continuous collaboration with stakeholders, and being open to feedback are my top priorities. This approach not only ensures a clear understanding of the project requirements but also facilitates the creation of a system that truly meets the users' needs.
